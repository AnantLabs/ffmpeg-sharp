	* Added VideoDecoderStream, and refactored common code from audio and video
	decoding into the DecoderStream base class
	* Added interop classes for the sws_* family of functions in FFmpeg.
	However, I couldn't make these functions work in VideoDecoderStream
	so they have been commented out
	* Tweaked some of the interop method signatures to get them working
	for video decoding
